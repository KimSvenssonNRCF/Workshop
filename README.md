# Workshop
A repository for all Code written for the workshop in my project.

Follow the project at: https://nrcf-programming.blogg.lu.se/

Test01 will contain the first iteration of the workshop, both the planned code and the written code.
Eventually, more iterations will be added as the project progresses and a final version will see the light of day at some point in the future.

# How to use
Download Processing from https://processing.org/ and download the Python mode within the program.
Open any downloaded code using Processing and hit the 'run' button. Each code needs all its parts to work, so make sure to download every piece of code within each directory.
